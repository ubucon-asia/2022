### Session title and abstracts
Give us overview and details of your session. Title should be kept concise and display main topic of your session, And abstract should contain detailed overview of your session. You can also include some breif agenda on session abstract.

#### Choosing topics
- Please note that this is an Ubuntu event. Ubuntu related topics will get much higher priority. Please suggest a topic that is at least slightly related to Ubuntu and the technologies related with Ubuntu ecosystem or Ubuntu community.
- Please be specific! Topics such as "What is Ubuntu?", "What is Security", "What is Social Engineering" is too much broad! In most cases, these kinds of topics can be rejected.
- Generic topics such as "Incident Management", "Managing your stress", "Create your personal strategic plan", "Team Dynamics & Communication Skills" might be suitable for public lectures, But usually not suitable for our event. If you relate generic topics with Ubuntu projects or community, that might be suitable for our event. For example, just talking about Tax and Tax accounting is not suitable for our event, But what about talking your experience on managing accounting and tax for UbuCon or other Ubuntu community activities? That would be interesting topic for other Ubuntu folks!
- Please refrain suggesting proposal for just simply delivering information, especially proposals that reveal the intent of the advertisement.  
   - Many audiences attend for the presenter's own experience or hard-to-find information, rather than information that can be easily found by searching online.
   - Your unique experiences and cases, case studies of using Ubuntu or related open sources in your company, and contents related to Ubuntu or related open sources helpful for audiences are welcomed.
- If you want to find references, You may have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubucon for sessions at previous UbuCons.
#### Good and bad examples

**Let's see some bad examples first.**

>Installing Ubuntu
>
>Let's Install Ubuntu today!

Why it's bad proposal?
- This topics is too broad. There are many variant of Ubuntu, Which variant on what kind of hardware? Desktop Ubuntu on ThinkPad laptops?
- Installing Ubuntu is something easily found by web search. This is not much suitable for our event.
- The abstract doesn't provide enough informations. It just says `Let's Install Ubuntu today!` and that's all. Most people will have no idea what this speaker will talk about.

>Developing and Containerizing ASP.NET App
>
>In this session, I'll talk about setting up development environment for ASP.NET on Windows or Mac environment and initializing ASP.NET project with .Net CLI.
>You will also learn how to write Dockerfile for your ASP.NET project and build container image for your ASP.NET App

Why it's bad proposal?  
This proposal might be good proposal for .Net event. But we're Ubuntu event not .Net event. This topic is not suitable for our event. In most cases, this proposal will be rejected on our event.

**Now here's good examples.**

This one is actually a session from last year.

>Hacking on UnityX and building Ubuntu Remixes
>
>I’ll first be showing how to set up a build environment for UnityX. I’ll also demonstrate how to do a Merge Request on GitLab and package UnityX using qckdeb. We recently released our ISO builder for anyone to use it for creating Ubuntu remix ISOs. I’ll be demonstrating how easy it is to use the builder by creating an Ubuntu Remix live using UnityX.

Why it's good proposal?
- Concise title that shows specific topic. People can know this speaker will talk about how to work on UnityX project and build Ubuntu Remix images.
- From the abstract, Audiances can exactly know what that they will learn. Such as how to setup environment for UnityX, open merge request for UnityX and build Ubuntu Remix ISO image. 


>Developing ASP.NET App on Ubuntu and Containerizing with Chiseled Ubuntu .Net Container image
>
>Did you know that .Net is not available as Ubuntu package? You can now install with `sudo apt install dotnet6`! Let's setup and get started with ASP.NET development on your Ubuntu environment. After that, You will also learn about Chiseled Ubuntu .Net Container image which was announced with `dotnet6` package availability. And how to build ASP.NET app container image with that and some advantages of using Chiseled iamges. 

Why it's good proposal?
- Concise and sprcific title and detailed abstract that audiances an know what they will learn from the session.
- The session not only talk about just .Net but also relate with some Ubuntu topics such as Ubuntu container images. Which makes this session suitable for our event.

### Choose your session difficulty level
Good presentation needs to be taken with consideration of the target audience and difficulty.
- It might not be a wise decision for choosing “Beginner” for a session that talks about advanced topics on GNOME with some C++ code snippets.
- One the other hand, It is also not a proper decision to choose “Advanced’ for Community/Social Context topics.

#### Beginner
These audiences have beginner experience on Ubuntu and Linux, and might not have deep understanding of open source communities. For sessions targeted beginners, Topics such as “Get started with using Linux GUI App”, “Introduction to using CLI” that would help people to jump to intermediate level are suitable.

#### Intermediate
These audiences have many experiences using Ubuntu and Linux, and might already be participating in open source communities. We can also suppose that they use CLI and other tools included on Ubuntu for their needs. Sharing knowledge or experiences on specific area, know-hows on troubleshooting would be suitable.

#### Advanced
These audiences already have a deep understanding of Ubuntu, its ecosystems and related open source technologies, and actively use Ubuntu on their projects and work. They might also actively participate and contribute to open source communities. Topics on internal implementation, how the internal system works and its application would be suitable.

Please review our guideline above once again and see if you chose the proper difficulty level. You may update your proposal if you think the difficulty level does not fit with the topic. In case we find that the difficulty level you chose does not fit with your topic, We will contact you to discuss. Please join our discussion to improve your proposal.

### Prior knowledge and what participants need to prepare
Are there any prior knowledge that audiences should have to understand your session? Please specify if any. If your session is workshop and participants need to prepare something before participating such as software installation, online service sign up, bringing specific equipment, make sure to specify in your proposal.

### What audiences can learn from your session
Why participants will need to join your session? What can audiences learn from your session? Think about some attract points of your session and specify in your proposal.

### Other thing you need to know and consider
- We do not choose proposal based on your profile. But we choose based on content of your proposal.
  - Do not include your personal information such as nationality, where you live, affiliation, gender and sexual orientation, race, and disability. In case we found these, It will be removed during review process.
- What do you want to convey? Through your session, What would you like to share?
  - Your session duration is limited. Write your proposal concretely so that you can deliver the content within a given time.
- Do not submit large number of proposals at once. That doesn't increase possibility of your proposal adoption. But we may take that as spam and reject all of your proposals. Instead, As we try to invite as much speakers as possible, Put your efforts on writting a single good proposals.
### Discussion on your proposal
After submitting the proposal, detailed discussions and meetings on the content of the proposal may be held until a final decision is made. If you submit your proposal with a little leeway, you can improve the proposal through consultation and meeting with the organizing team.
