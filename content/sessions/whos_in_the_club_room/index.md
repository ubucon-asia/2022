I am working as an executive in the computer central club of the school. Among the executives, as one of technology-related executives, I contribute to the club by maintaining various services (GitLab, Wiki, Mail, etc.) used by members and the Backoffice that executives use for club management.

A few months ago, requests began to come in steadily, saying, "I wish there's a way to know who's in the club room." In fact, it was a difficult task unless equipping a camera, and mounting a camera was excluded due to various problems.

While we were thinking about this, what we considered was WiFi. Club members are always connected to WiFi when they visit the club room. If we can only know who is accessing this WiFi, we can know who is in the club room.

In this session, under the topic of "Who is in the club room right now?", I would like to talk about the problems encountered in the process of planning and building the software and infrastructure for this project.
