Short introduction of our team, explaining the difference between normal PCs which Linux x86_64 is targeted on and 2018 or newer Macs with T2 chip which are very different despite using same Intel CPU, our efforts trying to get Linux run on those Macs, including but not limited to reverse engineering, writing kernel module, building and automating supporting packages for multiple distros including Ubuntu. We'll demonstrate Ubuntu running on Macs with our efforts. See https://t2linux.org and https://wiki.t2linux.org to see what we do.

## Prior knowledge 
Some knowledge of Linux and kernel, Some understanding about Apple's Mac platform.

## What audience can learn from this session
Differences between normal PCs and 2018+ Macs, the presence of t2linux project, what we do, what we have achieved, and our future roadmap. Since our project is not well known and not many people know the difference between later stage Intel Macs and normal PCs this will introduce people to those differences and knowledge about Intel Mac's different internals.
