> ONLYOFFICE Sponosred session

Most documents we have to deal with routinely are model, universally structured files: agreements, briefs, contracts, budget plans, etc. All processes involving repetition in document creation, editing, and collaboration have a chance to be optimized and automated. With this idea in mind, ONLYOFFICE has developed online form builder aimed at improving the process of file creation and sharing within organizational document flow. 

In this presentation, we will explore the scenarios of implementing ONLYOFFICE editors on Ubuntu systems to enable the use of form creation functionality with user specifics in mind:

- Solution and functionality overview;
- Available packaging and configuration;
- Integration with document management systems;
- Experience in ONLYOFFICE implementation by Ubuntu community;
- ONLYOFFICE solutions distribution, localization, and technical support on Korean market and within broader Asia region.

## What audience can learn from this session
In this session, we will present online form creation functionality in ONLYOFFICE Docs, explain the mechanisms behind this functionality, and show how paperwork automation can be improved with forms.
